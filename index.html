    <h1>Resat Amin Pria</h1>
    <p>Student @BRACU</p>

    <p>I am an undergrad Law student at <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/institutes-and-schools/school-law">BRAC University</a>. I am also pursuing Anthropology as my minor subject. I am more
        like a person who is floating in the ocean to find the meaning of life. I want to see life from a
        socio-political view, describe life through musical notes, decorate it by nature and serve it like a well cooked
        delicious dish. </p>
    <p>I am the person who loves to play instruments without following the tempo, loves to cook without following any
        recipe, loves to read anything and loves to talk and discuss with new people about life, politics, literature and
        history.</p>
    <p>I want to work on social justice and social rights in future.
        Sometimes I sound really a depressive one but deep inside I am so optimistic about life and the Earth.
