    <p>
        I am a peer educator at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cholokothaboli">Katha</a>. My main area of focus is on
        tackling gender-based violence in Bangladesh by means of sexuality education, research, and interactive
        discussion. I have earned my bachelor's degree with a Law major and an Anthropology minor from <a
            href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/institutes-and-schools/school-law">BRAC University</a>. During my
        undergraduate studies, I developed an interest in the connections between law and digital anthropology. I am
        also intrigued by cyber law, digital security act, and human rights issues in Bangladesh.
