## Social Media as a Battleground: A Qualitative Analysis of the Representation and Resistance of Feminist Activism in Bangladesh.
Existing research highlights the online harassment of women and celebrities, but few studies explore how digital discourse shapes feminist activism in the Global South. This study analyzes 600 Facebook comments to investigate the anti-feminist backlash against feminist activists in Bangladesh, expressed through trolling, hate speech, stereotypes, and misinformation. The analysis reveals how feminist activists are often portrayed as "morally corrupt," "unattractive," and "unfeminine," with these negative traits linked to perceptions of feminism as a foreign, Western-driven ideology. Such representations reinforce patriarchal norms, marginalize women, and silence feminist voices. Unlike previous research that focused on television celebrities and social media influencers' harassment on social media, this study examines the broader societal implications of these portrayals on perceptions of gender roles. It also identifies four key strategies feminist activists use to counter these stereotypes: satire and humorous reappropriation, exposing hypocrisy, calling out personal attacks, and challenging right-wing associations. The study critiques both anti-feminist and feminist responses for failing to address structural economic inequalities exacerbated by neoliberal practices. It concludes by advocating for more impactful feminist activism that reclaims its radical roots, separates itself from neoliberal influences, and prioritizes economic justice.



## Why does the state need a god? A case study on Bangladesh in the context of protecting religious sentiment in Social Media.
The relationship between religion, politics, and the Digital Security Act 2018 (DSA) in Bangladesh has sparked significant debate, with the DSA widely criticized for enabling authoritarian control. However, the underlying legal framework, rooted in colonial-era British laws, remains largely unexamined. This study challenges the view that the DSA represents a solely contemporary issue, arguing instead that it reflects the long-term impact of colonial legal systems designed to implement divide-and-rule policies. By analyzing 25 cases through the pattern of legal intervention, this research demonstrates that, beyond religion, the use of secularization and pre-existing oppressive legal structures also serves as tools for authoritarian governance. This study underscores the importance of examining these historical continuities to understand how laws are weaponized to maintain control and create societal divides.
