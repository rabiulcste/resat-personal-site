### Challenges of Digital Secuirity Act 2018

This research project examines the challenges posed by cyber security laws and policies in Bangladesh in relation to human rights laws. It explores the legal frameworks in Bangladesh which regulate cyber security and their impacts on the protection of human rights. The research also looks at the effectiveness of these laws and policies in protecting the digital rights of individuals. It provides insights into the various issues that arise when cyber security laws and policies conflict with human rights laws, as well as possible solutions to help address these challenges. The findings of the research could be used to help inform future policy-making decisions in Bangladesh.

### Social Movements and Class struggles

This project aims to analyze and compare the engagement of urban middle-class people in social movements. By studying the dynamics of political hegemony, it seeks to understand how this class of people interact with and shape the movements. It will examine the various forms of engagement, such as protest, participation, and the mobilization of resources, as well as the motivations, ambitions, and goals of these people. Additionally, it will consider the role of the media, social networks, and other digital platforms in influencing the behavior of middle-class people. Ultimately, this project aims to provide valuable insight into the role of the middle-class in social movements and the possible implications for politics and society.
