## Violence
Violence has continued in Afghanistan despite peace talks that began in September. Twin explosions in the central Afghan city of Bamiyan on Tuesday killed at least 14 people, injuring 45 or more, media reports said.
According to a press release from UNAMA, donors pledged at least US$ 3.3 billion for the first year of the upcoming four year period, "with annual commitments expected to stay at the same level year-on-year.". But the money was not free, Ms. Lyons said: donors expected it would be well spent and the Government would be held accountable for how it was distributed, with an expectation that the country would hold on to the gains made in the past and keep strengthening institutions of governance and the protection of human rights.
Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto, whose Government co-hosted the event together with Afghanistan and the United Nations, said 66 governments and more than 30 international organisations had taken part in the conference, mostly online, because of COVID-19.
“All eyes in Afghanistan are towards Geneva”, said Afghan Deputy Minister of Finance Abdul Habib Zadran. “They are expecting a lot from the international community.”
