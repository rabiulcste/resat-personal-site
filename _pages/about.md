## About Me

I am Resat, a second-year sociology graduate student at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/artsandletters/sociology/). My research focuses on the intersection of society and emerging technologies, particularly how digital platforms shape public discourse, mediate power dynamics, and perpetuate social inequalities. I am broadly interested in the impact of [AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07924) on society, algorithmic [biases](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/), and [digital oppression](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/predict-and-surveil-9780190684099) within digital media.

Originally from Dhaka, Bangladesh, my early exposure to histories of colonization, feminist movements, and liberation shaped my commitment to social justice and equality. Growing up alongside the rise of social media platforms, I witnessed firsthand their transformative power in amplifying marginalized voices and organizing social movements. This early fascination with digital spaces, combined with my interest in structural inequalities, led me to pursue law initially, before discovering my true passion lay in understanding the sociological dynamics between institutions, technology, and gender-based inequalities. My feminist perspective particularly informs my approach to examining how digital technologies intersect with systems of power and oppression.

As a founding member of [Kendrobimukhi](https://www.facebook.com/kendrobimukhi/) and a peer educator with [Kotha](https://www.facebook.com/cholokothaboli), I leveraged digital platforms to promote gender equity and social justice. My work includes creating accessible content through projects like Feminism101 on TikTok, making complex social issues more approachable for broader audiences.


I identify as a socialist feminist and find joy in discussing contemporary social issues, music, books, and cooking. An avid runner training for my first marathon in 2025, I try to maintain a daily 6-kilometer routine. When not engaged in academic work, you might find me reading on train journeys or playing instruments to decompress.
