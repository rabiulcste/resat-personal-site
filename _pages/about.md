## About Me
I have completed my undergrad from School of Law,[BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/institutes-and-schools/school-law).

I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city of over 16 million people. I have always enjoyed playing [instruments](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=536960813850054) and cooking, and love learning new things. I am always up for [conversations](https://www.facebook.com/bracuanthropologyforum/posts/pfbid0zAcMzfMFs4Yy9EvE3EUSqTGH9e4ZuHVrf61sUsM84fLVUSD2jXpQT1Z1xYxkKHpl) about books-to-read, society, feminism and politics. I enjoy meeting new people and exploring new coffeeshops in Dhaka.
