## About Me
I am a recent graduate of the School of Law at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/academics/institutes-and-schools/school-law)in Dhaka, Bangladesh. With a minor in anthropology, I have developed a passion for understanding the complexities of human society and the legal systems that govern them.

I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh, a city of over 16 million people. I have always enjoyed playing [instruments](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=536960813850054) and cooking, and love learning new things. I am always up for [conversations](https://www.facebook.com/bracuanthropologyforum/posts/pfbid0zAcMzfMFs4Yy9EvE3EUSqTGH9e4ZuHVrf61sUsM84fLVUSD2jXpQT1Z1xYxkKHpl) about books-to-read, society, feminism and politics. I enjoy meeting new people and exploring new coffeeshops in Dhaka.

## Activism and Online Presence
I am passionate about promoting social justice and equality in Bangladesh, and I use online platforms to voice my opinions and raise awareness about pressing gender concerns, human rights issues, and the Digital Security Act. As an advocate for digital security and privacy, I believe that it is essential to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights in the digital world. I am an occasional writer and researcher on these topics, and I actively participate in online discussions and forums.
