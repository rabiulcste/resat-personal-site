## About Me
I am Resat, a second-year sociology graduate student at [Florida Atlantic University](https://www.fau.edu/artsandletters/sociology/). As an aspiring sociologist in the information age, I have a keen interest in studying the impact of [AI-generated identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07924), [biases](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/), and [digital oppression](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/predict-and-surveil-9780190684099) within the realm of digital media. 

I am from Dhaka, Bangladesh, a country of 18 million people. I grew up reading about the history of oppression in my country, from British colonization to the liberation war against Pakistan. This history instilled in me a strong sense of freedom, justice, and equality. Growing up, I developed a passion for social justice, seeking to establish equality for all and advocating for the rights of minorities.

Driven by this passion, I pursued my undergraduate major in law with the belief that I could change the world and stand up against all forms of oppression. However, during law school, my interest shifted toward understanding the intersection between law, society, humans, and institutions. I pursued a minor in anthropology, which led me to question “how” some processes work within institutions and some not, and ultimately, the social science question  "why."  

I am open to collaborating on research related to digital media, AI, gender, human sexuality, technology, and human rights  Additionally, I am open to engaging in conversations with new people and learning new things. 

I am a socialist feminist who loves discussing contemporary social issues, music, books, cooking, black coffee, and playing instruments when I feel emotionally overwhelmed. I run 6 kilometers at a 7-minute-per-kilometer pace each day, and I dream of participating in my first marathon in 2025. I enjoy reading books during lonely train journeys and often imagine myself as a character in a movie set in Europe, with people watching me. Within a few seconds, my concerns about surveillance start to give me a hard time about this careless and romanticizing attitude toward being monitored.
