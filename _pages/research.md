              Existing research highlights the online harassment of women and celebrities, but few studies explore how digital discourse shapes 
              feminist activism in the Global South. This study analyzes 600 Facebook comments to investigate the anti-feminist backlash against 
              feminist activists in Bangladesh.

                The analysis reveals how feminist activists are often portrayed as "morally corrupt," "unattractive," and "unfeminine," 
                with these negative traits linked to perceptions of feminism as a foreign, Western-driven ideology. Such representations 
                reinforce patriarchal norms, marginalize women, and silence feminist voices. Unlike previous research that focused on 
                television celebrities and social media influencers' harassment on social media, this study examines the broader societal 
                implications of these portrayals on perceptions of gender roles.
              </p>
              <p>
                The study identifies four key strategies feminist activists use to counter these stereotypes: satire and humorous 
                reappropriation, exposing hypocrisy, calling out personal attacks, and challenging right-wing associations. The study 
                critiques both anti-feminist and feminist responses for failing to address structural economic inequalities exacerbated 
                by neoliberal practices. It concludes by advocating for more impactful feminist activism that reclaims its radical roots, 
                separates itself from neoliberal influences, and prioritizes economic justice.

              The relationship between religion, politics, and the Digital Security Act 2018 (DSA) in Bangladesh has sparked significant debate, 
              with the DSA widely criticized for enabling authoritarian control. However, the underlying legal framework, rooted in colonial-era 
              British laws, remains largely unexamined.

                This study challenges the view that the DSA represents a solely contemporary issue, arguing instead that it reflects the 
                long-term impact of colonial legal systems designed to implement divide-and-rule policies. By analyzing 25 cases through 
                the pattern of legal intervention, this research demonstrates that, beyond religion, the use of secularization and 
                pre-existing oppressive legal structures also serves as tools for authoritarian governance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This study underscores the importance of examining these historical continuities to understand how laws are weaponized 
                to maintain control and create societal divides. The research reveals how colonial-era legal frameworks continue to shape 
                contemporary governance strategies, providing insights into the mechanisms of state power and control in post-colonial contexts.
