These days, I wonder why all the directors are portraying Dhaka as a dark city on the OTT platform. There is an abundance of murder, rape, cannibalism, and other scary things shown in a super chaotic way. Is Dhaka really this scary? Should we be more cautious and safe? Live with fear, anxiety, and distrust of one another?

I love watching series about serial killing, psychothrillers, horror, and crime. But recently, I found that these series are only excellent when the scene is set in Florida, Miami, or Mexico--places where I don't live. But when the scene is set in my city, it's really hard for me to watch. It gives me so much anxiety and panic attacks. So, I stopped watching our OTT dramas and tried to avoid bad news on Facebook as well. 
Then, I saw a post on Instagram about a third-year student in the Civil Engineering department at Buet who was found dead in Narayanganj. I saw his missing diary post a couple of days ago and didn't think much of it. But finding out he's dead while scrolling Instagram hits me hard. The first question that came to mind was whether Buet is cursed or something. Though, his death is a result of this cursed country. Cursed by greed, cursed by corruption, cursed by lack of the rule of law, condemned by authority and whatnot! I know this is a regular thing here. Nothing to stress out all of a sudden. But sometimes you know, it gets my nerve so badly.

I'm not just talking about one person or one crime. I'm talking about the situation in our country. I mean the overall condition of this country. I'm fully aware of the dark reality of this country. But today I just felt so bad that I can't feel any other thing. I'm angry, frustrated, helpless, and terrified.
